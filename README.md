# vimrc - One editor to rule them all.
I am a DevOps Engineer currently based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Much of my day-to-day work involves reading/writing in Python and Go, as well as writing Ansible playbooks, Kubernetes manifests, Jenkinsfiles, Dockerfiles, and such. 

I use vim as my primary editor because I want one consistent experience whether I'm on my local machine or I have ssh'd onto a remote machine (needing to ssh anywhere is a serious system design flaw IMO, but I digress) rather than having to mentally switch between vim, VSCode, Atom or whatever, or without having to worry if I'm on a Windows machine, using my Linux daily driver, or have gotten ahold of a Mac.

Please feel free to use and modify my .vimrc to fit your needs, but do also be mindful of the licenses involved (especially those in the vim plugins this .vimrc references) and, if you can, please do contribute back to the vim community.
